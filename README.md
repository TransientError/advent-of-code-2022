My code for advent of code

### Early days (typescript)
I wanted to try out typescript with [bun](https://bun.sh/).

You can run each script using `bun run <path>`

### Later days (python)
Eventually I realized that collections were pretty broken in typescript, so I tried a few other languages and settled on Python.
(It looks like CPython is about the same performance as bun for these problems anyway)

You can run most of these with straight `python`. If I needed some dependency, you can activate the venv using `poetry shell`. You can find more information on poetry here: https://python-poetry.org/.


### misc
#### Rust
I also have the odd Rust solution I created for friends learning Rust.
They are not really that runnable as-is. I suppose you could copy it into `src/main.rs` and use `cargo run`

#### Go
`go run`

## Benchmarks
I have some random benchmarks that the coding questions inspired me to try out in the benchmarks directory.

My code for advent of code

I wanted to try out typescript with [bun](https://bun.sh/).

You can run each script using `bun run <path>`

Eventually I realized that collections were pretty broken in typescript, so I tried a few other languages and settled on Python.

(It looks like CPython is about the same performance as bun for these problems anyway)

I also have the odd Rust solution I created for friends learning Rust.

## Benchmarks
I have some random benchmarks that the coding questions inspired me to try out in the benchmarks directory.
